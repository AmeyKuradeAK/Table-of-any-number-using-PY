# Table-of-any-number-using-PY
Mathematical Table Generator using PY

# Write a program which does the following:

* Recall the previous module where we printed the Table of a given number.
* Take a number input from the console sample input
* We need to output to the console the multiplication table for that number using the "for" loop in the format given in the IDE

# Sample 
> Input\
> 10
     
> Output\
>10 x 1 = 10\
>10 x 2 = 20\
>10 x 3 = 30\
>10 x 4 = 40\
>10 x 5 = 50\
>10 x 6 = 60\
>10 x 7 = 70\
>10 x 8 = 80\
>10 x 9 = 90\
>10 x 10 = 100
